                <p>My journey into software engineering started unexpectedly with AI—when I first encountered it,
                     I was captivated by the potential of machine learning and data analytics.
                      What began as curiosity quickly evolved into a passion, and since then,
                       I've immersed myself in projects like building predictive models for the NFL Data Bowl
                        and collaborating with the University of Michigan Men's Basketball team (See experiences for more).

                <p> Outside of the classroom, I enjoy hanging out with my friends, playing video games,
                     and watching sports. Whether it's Poker Night or Sunday Night Football,
                      I enjoy the thrill of strategy, the camaraderie that comes with competition,
                       and the opportunity to sharpen my analytical skills while having fun.

                    <h4>Ray Tracer</h4>
                    <p>Engineered a fully functional ray tracer in C++ which handled scenes with up to 1 million rays per frame and dropped
                        rendering time by up to 50% for complex scenes through special partition optimization.
                         Boosted the rendering pipeline using Monte Carlo integration, resulting in a 30% increase in rendering accuracy for
                        light behavior simulations.
                         Leveraged multi-threading and optimized memory management to accelerate rendering performance, reducing
                        computation times by 40% in high-complexity environments.

                        removal, and TF-IDF vectorization, to condense posts school discussion platform into accurate summaries.
                         Integrated Machine Learning algorithms such as transformer-based models (BERT, GPT) for supervised learning on
                        large-scale datasets, achieving an amortized accuracy rate of 80%.
                         Executed data preprocessing pipelines and model optimization to increase performance by 30% and reduce inference
                        time by 20%.
